Python program to solve the HQ Trivia app questions

I've created a bot/program in python for the app/game HQ Trivia found on Android and iOS.
It uses any screen mirroring program to screenshot your phone, crop the image to only contain the questions and answers, 
reads it using Google's Vision API, searches the question comparing results to the answer and 
trying to find the 'most correct' answer
